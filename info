- Do not render beach & shoal if tagged as seamark:type
- Do not show track-outline on sportspitches if also tagged as leisure = track

Routing

- Improved long distance routing by adjusting road-classes
- Improved long distance routing by adding missing roudnabout junctions for primary_link, tertiary_link and secondary_link
- Major routing improvement by evaluating all the access-tags before setting the highway type. If no transportation type is allowed anyhow then
		now the the road is of a non routable type in the first place (for a small country like belgium it eliminates 32.000 roads to be inaccesible
- Add routable overlay on man_made=pier to enhance routing through ferry for pedestrians and cyclists
- Add routable overlay on leisure = track if also taged as highway=foot to enable routing
- Fixed bug where residential and unclassified round-abouts generated a double overlay

   This Introduces a new  access file. Covering almost 99,99% of all tagging. Also for emergency hgv, psv, bus, taxi and toll flags
   Correct handling for barriers and highways. This should improve routing a lot.
